# Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using Linear Regression. The model is trained on the `housing.csv` dataset, which includes features such as median income, total rooms, population, and more.

## Objectives

- Load and validate the dataset
- Handle missing values in `total_bedrooms`
- Perform feature preprocessing and selection
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data handling
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Google Colab for development and execution

## Files Included

- `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb` — Main notebook with all code, preprocessing, and analysis
- `housing.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing

## Results

The trained Linear Regression model effectively predicts housing prices based on the given features. Performance is assessed using standard regression metrics to ensure model accuracy and reliability.
